Then Twitter’s newest feature is for you. Or, rather, it’s for everyone else but you... If Twitter can get this newest initiative right, we’ll all be better off..."
08/10/18,Slate,Will Oremus,,Why Twitter Is Tolerating Alex Jones and Courting the Right Wing,Four Theories,https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/why-twitter-hasnt-banned-alex-jones-four-theories.html,"First, Dorsey defended Twitter’s decision not to ban Alex Jones, even after Facebook, YouTube, Apple, and numerous other media platforms cracked down on the Infowars host for hate speech and bullying. “The reason is simple,” Dorsey wrote on Tuesday evening. “He hasn’t violated our rules.” (That assertion, echoed by Twitter Vice President Del Harvey in a letter to employees on Wednesday, was debunked by CNN’s Oliver Darcy on Thursday.)...Why, at a time when all the momentum in the social media industry was aligned against the likes of Alex Jones, is Twitter taking a stand in his favor—and promoting it on a right-wing radio show? ...Few outside of Twitter’s executive offices can make sense of the company’s reasoning. In a piece that circulated widely on Thursday, the Atlantic’s Adrienne LaFrance found Dorsey’s stance on Alex Jones so absurd that she could only conclude that he and other tech CEOs “don’t give a damn.” While her critique was powerful, the conclusion doesn’t jibe with what insiders know of Dorsey..."
05/15/18,Wired,Louise Matsakis,,Twitter Will Begin Hiding All Tweets From Suspect Accounts,,https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-will-begin-hiding-all-tweets-from-suspect-accounts/,"Those whose tweets are deemed to be ""disruptive,"" but that don't violate Twitter's policies outright, will be secluded at the bottom of a conversation thread or search result, to make room for more productive and respectful conversations... The new moderation tactics will likely make the service better, and more useful for the average user. If you want to know how Twitter is digesting the president's latest tweet, it's significantly more helpful to have thoughtful replies at the top rather than bots trying to sell ""liberal tears"" mugs... Instead of striving for neutrality, Twitter is again prioritizing better conversations, as it continues to examine what a healthy conversation looks like online."

Dorsey would be elated were the likes Mike Cernovich to voluntarily join the already-exiled Milo somewhere (anywhere!) else. "

Twitter has faced harsh criticism from congress for its role in amplifying the voices of Russian bots and troll accounts working to inflame American politics and culture, and influence the 2016 presidential election."

Social media services can only act to remove domestic disinformation when the American groups that are making and distributing it start to use techniques that violate the companies’ terms of service, such as creating false accounts.""
