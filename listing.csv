Then Twitter’s newest feature is for you. Or, rather, it’s for everyone else but you... If Twitter can get this newest initiative right, we’ll all be better off..."

In a piece that circulated widely on Thursday, the Atlantic’s Adrienne LaFrance found Dorsey’s stance on Alex Jones so absurd that she could only conclude that he and other tech CEOs “don’t give a damn.” While her critique was powerful, the conclusion doesn’t jibe with what insiders know of Dorsey..."
05/15/18,Wired,Louise Matsakis,,Twitter Will Begin Hiding All Tweets From Suspect Accounts,,https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-will-begin-hiding-all-tweets-from-suspect-accounts/,"Those whose tweets are deemed to be ""disruptive,"" but that don't violate Twitter's policies outright, will be secluded at the bottom of a conversation thread or search result, to make room for more productive and respectful conversations... The new moderation tactics will likely make the service better, and more useful for the average user. If you want to know how Twitter is digesting the president's latest tweet, it's significantly more helpful to have thoughtful replies at the top rather than bots trying to sell ""liberal tears"" mugs... Instead of striving for neutrality, Twitter is again prioritizing better conversations, as it continues to examine what a healthy conversation looks like online."

Dorsey would be elated were the likes Mike Cernovich to voluntarily join the already-exiled Milo somewhere (anywhere!) else. "

Twitter has faced harsh criticism from congress for its role in amplifying the voices of Russian bots and troll accounts working to inflame American politics and culture, and influence the 2016 presidential election."

Social media services can only act to remove domestic disinformation when the American groups that are making and distributing it start to use techniques that violate the companies’ terms of service, such as creating false accounts.""

He would see the work of an army of Twitter trolls, ordered to attack him and other influential Saudis who had criticized the kingdom’s leaders. He sometimes took the attacks personally, so friends made a point of calling frequently to check on his mental state... “The mornings were the worst for him because he would wake up to the equivalent of sustained gunfire online,” said Maggie Mitchell Salem, a friend of Mr. Khashoggi’s for more than 15 years."

Like it or not, Twitter is a publisher, not a common carrier like the phone company or the public square, to which many have compared it. As a publisher, Twitter has established standards of conduct for what may appear in its pages. You might disagree with those standards and the way the company enforces them, but it’s Twitter’s house"
